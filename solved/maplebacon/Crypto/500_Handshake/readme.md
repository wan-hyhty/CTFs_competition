Points: 500 

Description:
In a world where distance often reigns,
There lies a gesture that breaks all chains.
A simple act, though brief it stands,
The gentle meeting of two hands.
With fingers clasped in tender grip,
A silent oath from lip to lip.
In the warm embrace of palm to palm,
There breathes a universal calm.

Amid the storms that time commands,
We find our anchor in shaking hands.
It sows the seeds of friendship's lands,
A bridge that spans all life's expanses.
In this brief touch, love understands,
The boundless power of shaking hands.
An age-old dance, lifeâ€™s sweetest strands,
Bound together, in shaking hands.
