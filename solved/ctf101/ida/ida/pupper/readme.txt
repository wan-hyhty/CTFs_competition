You've received a linux executable file in your first class in defence against the dark arts. If you run it, you'll understand that the flag was written in memory, but wasn't shown. There are many ways to retrieve it. Since the flag is a string in the binary, we could simply list all the strings contained in the challenge by using the strings command (on linux) like so : strings harry_pupper. We could also use a decompiler such as dogbolt.org and check for the flag in the decompiled code.
