# No end in sight

The fl4gtory keeps falling apart! All the flag-making fluid is overflowing and starting to destroy our shells. See if you can save them...

This is the third challenge in the pwn intro series


Some helpful tools and tipps:
- We have provided source code for this challenge, but if you want you can of course also solve it without source code. If you want to do this have a look at [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/). Also have a look at our intro rev challenge `on-time-production`
- For debugging, gdb is very helpful and [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) makes this experience much nicer
- For writing your exploits, [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) is a great library. We have provided an skeleton pwntools script. You just have to provide the exploit ;)
- (See `HELP.md` in the handout for `on-time-production` for a little more detailed explaination to ghidra and pwntools)
