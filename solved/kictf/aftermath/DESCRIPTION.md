# Aftermath


Wait, this was the end? Well then, time to prevent this from happening again. Go on and write some instructions to solve problems like these for your fellow fl4g-producers. Also, have some delicious pie.

This is the fourth and last challenge in the pwn intro series


Some helpful tools and tipps:
- We have provided source code for this challenge, but if you want you can of course also solve it without source code. If you want to do this have a look at [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/). Also have a look at our intro rev challenge `on-time-production`
- For debugging, gdb is very helpful and [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) makes this experience much nicer
- For writing your exploits, [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) is a great library. We have provided an skeleton pwntools script. You just have to provide the exploit ;)
- (See `HELP.md` in the handout for `on-time-production` for a little more detailed explaination to ghidra and pwntools)
